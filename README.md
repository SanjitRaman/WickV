# WickV Compiler

This repository contains our C90 to RISC-V compiler completed as part of the Instruction Architectures and Compilers coursework, taken by students in their second year of an Electronic and Information Engineering (EIE) degree at Imperial College London.

The code passed 170/201 tests, scoring 85% overall, which placed us among the top 5 out of ~50 pairs in the cohort.

Overall, we were pleased with the compiler, and learnt a lot from this course, though there are several code smells that we introduced due to the intensity of the Spring term, which we hope to clean up post-submission.

P.S. the name, WickV, is a nod to the following:
- our professor, Dr John Wickerson
- The RISC-V instruction set architecture
- the John Wick movies that we both like (and the 5th one that came out this year)
